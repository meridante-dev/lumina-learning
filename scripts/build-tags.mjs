   build-tags.mjs — concept tags AT TIMESTAMPS.
   The graph says a lesson is "about leadership". This says WHERE: the seconds
   in the video where the trainer actually says it. Deterministic — a tag is a
   literal mention in the transcript, never a model's guess — so a chip that
   says "leadership · 4:32" seeks to a place where the word is spoken.
   Reads knowledge/search.json (every segment, with timecode) and graph.json
   (concept nodes + "about" edges). Writes knowledge/tags.json:
     { lessons: { "<course>:<mod>" | "reel:<id>": [ {c, at:[sec…], n, linked} ] } }
   A concept the graph already links needs ONE mention to be tagged; an
   unlinked concept must recur (3+ separate minutes) — discovery needs
   repetition, or every lesson would be tagged with every word.
